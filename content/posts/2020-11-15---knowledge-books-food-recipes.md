_**Knowledge books** is a mini series of constantly updated articles in which I share my more interesting discoveries_

Free time is a really good thing. We can use it freely - including cooking something extraordinary. In this time we can approach cooking with great creativity and eagerness. Having the recipe, we can modify it at will, there are no bad results. When finding a good new recipe, I will certainly keep the list updated. In the end, I will also look here myself to recall even the list of ingredients or the next steps.

## Chaliapin Steak Don
The recipe is obtained mainly from the Food Wars anime, which beautifully describes and imitates real recipes known all over the world. I had several approaches to this dish and I must admit, there are no bad results here - each variant tastes special. Don himself is really well described on the [CHEFPK channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TiCcI3s6ZM).

Ingredients:
- beef meat
- 1 onion / 200g meat
- rice
- peper & salt

Extras:
- maple syrup + miso for marinate
- Japanese prunes or other bitter dried fruit

As a first step, we prepare the onion by cutting it into cubes. Put the first layer on the plate, then put the meat in it and cover it with the second layer of onion. The beef should then wait in this state for half to two hours. While waiting for the taste to soak and soften the meat, we can prepare the rice. After that time, remove the onion from meat and saut√© it in a pan. Burn the meat in a frying pan and prepare it for the frying you want. The last step is to put rice, meat and a hill of onion into the bowl and pour the resulting sauce from the pan over it.

Modifications:
- The meat can be prepared sous vide by enclosing it in a bag together with the marinade
- An addition to rice can be rice sauce or dried Japanese cherry particles
- While in a rice cooker, you can add additional ingredients to make rice soak in additional flavors

## Massaman curry
It's worth experimenting in the kitchen. Thanks to them, we have rediscovery tasteful combinations of flavors. Last time I was able to put together a good combination for the curry

Ingredients:
- chicken/pork/beef meat
- 1 onion / 200g meat
- massaman curry paste
- rice
- soy sauce & teriyaki sauce
- salt, garlic, citric acid, ground paprika, ginger

Extras:
- yakisoba sauce
- dry wine 
- rice vinegar

Preparations should start with the onion glazing and rice cooking simultaneously. During frying, it is worth adding spices such as garlic, citric acid, and a pinch of salt to it. When the onion is almost ready, add the meat that will use the current sauce. To increase the flavor variation of the meat, you can add additional spices such as ground paprika or ginger. The next step is to pour coconut milk over the pan content and add the curry paste. Add soy and teriyaki sauce, rice vinegar, and reduce the sauce. Halfway through the process, add extra dry wine to enhance the umami of the curry. The finished product should be served in a bowl along with rice, cherry tomatoes, and chives. The variation in the preparation of the dish may simply change.

Modifications:
- a flavor variation to the cooking rice
    - yakisoba sauce and rice vinegar
    - soy sauce and a mixture of ground paprika
- curry works very well with the 5-taste variant (not 5-flavor variant), so add a different mix of spices
- rice to increase its taste, you can fry it slowly with an egg in a pan (it's worth adding spices to close them in the middle of the rice coated with egg protein)
