Lastly I found [a small repository](https://github.com/kyclark/tiny_python_projects) related to teaching book about Python. I must say, that even if project is directed to beginners in this language, doing that tasks is refreshing ever for more advanced people. So if you don't know what to do or want to clear your mind, you can always go to [Tiny Python Projects](http://tinypythonprojects.com/) site, and pick quick task to train your skills.
