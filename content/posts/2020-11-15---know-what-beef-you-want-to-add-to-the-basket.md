Buying good meat is really important. It may turn out that the meat seen on the promotion or on the shelf may not completely match our dish. Therefore, it makes sense to have a list of pieces of meat that are suitable for specific dishes. It is also worth being aware of what the meat should look like or what price you can expect.

I make a list of all these types after I bought a weaker quality entrecote, which turned out to be stringy at the very end. The dish was saved, but the steaks turned into a stew. It is worth considering whether the quality and price of the meat will not affect the taste of the dish. Unfortunately, it did not work after a small thermal treatment today.
