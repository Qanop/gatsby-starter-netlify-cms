_**Knowledge books** is a mini series of constantly updated articles in which I share my more interesting discoveries_

It happens that in the photos with the model we have no idea for new frames, or the ones that were used are repeated in each session. When looking for alternatives of styles, poses, arrangement of light or the use of objects in web, we often come across links that are not needed at the moment. However, it is worth saving them for later and grouping them.

## Pinterest

Every now and then, it's a good idea to sit down for a day and gather ideas. We can then save the collected photos or links in specific styles and present them to other people. Thanks to a well-prepared modboard, which looks different depending on the person who uses it, we can predict in what style a particular session would be aimed at. [Signing up is free](https://pinterest.com) and collecting ideas is really interesting. From one day and looking for similar photos, we can choose a lot of styles and inspirations.

## Poses

Missing poses for photos in the background can be supplemented using materials for artists. They often use real photos or the person themselves. Using the resources of, among others, the _Art Model Reference Images to Draw_ series created by New Masters Academy, with each episode we can be inspired by reference photos
