## I am a photographer.
In my spare time I do portrait photography. It is an interesting art that lead you to work and match up with another person. This way can open door to many styles of photography. Everyone works differently and different styles suit them. Therefore, each subsequent photo session gives me pleasure and allows me to implement more and more new ideas.  
I share my works most often by [posting on the Flickr channel](https://www.flickr.com/photos/atryniphotography/). Sometimes photos are also posted on social networks.


## I am a software developer.
The current commercial experience that I have is based on 3 programming languages. Each of the languages ​​used in the project is used for different purposes, but their placement gives the best possible results for the given task. I love learning about new technologies and tools. Thanks to them, we can set ourselves higher and higher design requirements and push the development of the project without fear of encountering a technological bottleneck. Of course, during the project breaks between programming tasks, I also deal with Ops and DevOps topics. 

Recently, I have been spending my time learning project-related procedures and tools as well as allowing for better server scalability. Time will show what you can get. :)

I would like to post my thoughts and actions on my website. This is a good place for me to take notes on a topic, find a solution to a topic, and maybe come back to it after a while. It is also an ideal situation to be able to share them with others. Well, maybe someone will come in handy someday when they have a problem. Either way, sharing what you've learned is the key to faster development. So... TEST> COMMIT> PUSH> RELEASE

In addition, apart from industry experience, I also learn and develop in other technologies. List of several projects in which I participated.

#### PRODUCT OFFERS SEARCH ENGINE FROM VARIOUS ADVERTISING PORTALS

Language: **ReactJS**, **Python/Scrapy**, **MongoDB**, **PHP/Symfony 5**

#### DEBIAN HOMESERVER PACKAGE MANAGER
Language: **BashScript**  
*During the next installation of Debian on my RaspberryPi device, I came up with the idea of creating an automatic script for installing basic tools that will be useful to new users. Therefore, through the prepared visual console menu, the user selects the corresponding software for his home standalone server such as PiHole, file/www server, instance manager and others. Script is under the MIT license and is open to extensions.*

#### PATTERN DETECTION IN HIGH QUALITY VIDEO STREAM
Technology: **Python**, **OpenCV**
*The project analyzed motion in real time using high resolution images. It was the first IT project that I fully built. It was used as part of the traffic analysis in Wrocław.*
