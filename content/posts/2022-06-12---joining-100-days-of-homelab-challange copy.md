At the beginning of the month, following the words of my friend, I started looking into putting up a HomeLab server. After many instances during this short journey, I finally managed to make a server to put up my home services, which I needed for a long time.

While building the server, in many cases I used tutorials, guides as well as best practice on YouTube. Turns out I also hit on the perfect opportunity to develop my current work with new event. [#100DaysOfHomeLab](https://100daysofhomelab.com/), an event created by [Techno Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwDVW_ifkBU) as a 100k celebration video, encourages you to spend 1 hour a day for 100 days developing your home environment. For the foreseeable future we may see a collaboration of the largest accounts dedicated to building a HomeLab. Each of the creators with a different approach to technology and the tools used - which can each be adapted to our needs. Along with this event, I have likewise planned new work that will expand my current setup.

Planned activities for near feuture:
- adding openHAB
- automated backups
- converting HomeLab to k3s

We'll see how many of these things I can get done. I will also try to give updates from week to week on the development of the project. I think this is a great option for everyone to join in creating their own HomeLab solution. To the next update!
