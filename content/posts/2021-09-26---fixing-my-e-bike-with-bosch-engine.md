In a word of introduction, I am the owner of an e-bike with a Bosch motor - as far as I can tell, it is the second version, powered by BatteryPack Classic 400 battery. I use the bike every day, and it allows me to get to many distant places in the city without much fatigue. Unfortunately, serving electronics for this type of equipment is a problem, and we are often left alone with repairing it. And in recent days one of the components failed.

But how did it happen? During the last transport of the bike I saw that the sensor of speedometer couldn't send data to my control unit, and because of this, the motor on my bike stopped working. As it turns out, the magnet that is read by the sensor should be at the height of the line marked on the sensor itself. After a day of searching, I found this information on one of the [YT videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RJLq0E1OhE)

Unfortunately, correcting the magnet did not solve the problem. The second point was that my battery in the Bosch BatteryPack Classic 400 suddenly shut down, and I could not read the status of the current draw from the LED lights, and the charger would not allow me to recharge the battery. It took me a long time to find the cause, but I found a [link on one of the bike forums](https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/52465/bosch-battery-stopped-charging) of a person with a similar problem. One of the causes of a faulty battery could be that it is protected from shorting out or receiving too high/low a temperature. When battery gets stuck and can't show charging status, just hold status button on it for 30s to give this component a soft reset. This way we can get the battery back in working order. 

Given method fixed my bike, and now I can power up by control unit + read speed, so I can continue to enjoy riding. I wanted to write this note here because it was hard for me to find information how to fix battery problem. I don't wish anyone to have this problem, but I will be glad if one day this post will help someone to solve this with his own equipment.
